## **`Context : `**
Human beings communicate with each other in the form of speech, gestures and emotions. As such, systems that can recognize the same are in great demand in many fields that aim to automate these visual and audio cues to communication. With respect to artificial intelligence, a computer will be able to interact with humans much more naturally if they are capable of understanding human emotion. Such a system would also be of great help in counseling and other healthcare related fields. In an E-Learning system for example, the presentation style may even be varied depending on the student's emotional state. The scope of applications for automatic facial emotion recognition is endless.

However in many cases, static emotion detection alone, is not very useful all by itself. It is essential to be aware of the user's feelings over a period of time in a live environment.

## **`Problem Statement : `**
Detecting the Facial Emotion using different Machine Learning and Deep learning models.

## **`DATASET : `**
The name of the data set is fer2013 which is an open-source data set that was made publicly available for a Kaggle competition. It contains 48x48 pixel grayscale facial images and it is not full fledged data. A part of the dataset is taken to get better understanding and inference of CNN's.

The original dataset has been modified such that there are only two emotion categories (0-Happy, 1=Not Happy) present in the current data.

## **`RESULT : `**
We built two models and the result observed were Accuracy of 63.67% on ANN where as Accuracy of 76.77 % on CNN.
